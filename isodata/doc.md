# Separating Features/Ideas
> roguelike aspects
    * one main dungeon line
    * maybe specific farming areas but short
    * one main town for management, might encounter settlements one the main line
> no focus on ultra-endgame
    * flow into new character creation
    * try to avoid chase items concept
> mix opposites
    * is it possible to have the good feel of building a character wo/ end game
    * try to have feel good character building wo/ massive grinding or chase items
> reborn mechanic?
    * keep some skills
    * keep progression
    * restart items?
